# METROSTROI AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE SETTER [MAVS] & METROSTROI AUTOMATIC CURRENT SETTER [MACS]
###### Working title :D

## What is MAVS and MACS?
MAVS and MACS is automated script what sets Voltage and Current limits accordingly to the map(s).
This script changes **metrostroi_current_limit** & **metrostroi_voltage** parameters.

As this is my first codding, the code might look very messy and not that nice to watch.
But i'm planning to rework the code later when i learn more of the coding :D
